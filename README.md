# Sign_Language_Recognition

## Task

SLR is an AI capable of understanding and interpreting different hand signs in real time. 
Based mainly on OpenCV library and a dataset from Kaggle, SLR is my first big project in Data Science...

I first process all the images based on their sign and draw points and lines on them, then the coordinates of those points are used as Input data for a small Neural Network.

Finally, the AI will tell me what language I use when reading from my Webcam.
